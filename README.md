# AvengerQuiz - CodingQuiz
For this project my job was to create a coding quiz for users to test their knowledge about coding.

My thought process behind this project was to make this quiz very fun and user freindly.

Within the quiz it consist of 4 coding questions for users to answer. As well a score of how many questions the user get's right. As well I added a 5 min timer for the user to complete the quiz within the time limit.
